# PROJECT DESIGN
The project uses Python's tools (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for an Exploratory Data Analysis and various Data Visualization graphs. Jupyter Notebook was used to write the code; Excel was used to keep the data scraped.

# OBJECTIVE
The project aims to investigate the hypothesis of a conflict of interests which involves in particular the online ticket selling platform Fandango, that happens to be a movie review platform. The answer we wanted to wanser with this project was the following: "Is Fandango increasing the movies scores in order to incentivize the movie tickets selling?". The projects aims to find out whether the Fandango platform is being objective with the reviews or manipulating them for their own interests.

# BACKGROUND
Imagine you're in in queue waiting to buy a ticket for a long anticipated movie. Suddenly you hear people getting out of the movie theater complaining about how boring, awful the movie was and how they wasted their money just to lose 2 hours of their life watching that. Of course you would be suddenly biased, and you would start questioning the decision to watch the movie anyway.
External bias is way more influencing than we think. That's how psychology works. And that's one of the reasons why we would question Fandango's being objective in posting movie reviews, being an online ticket selling platform as well.

# METHODOLOGY
In order to answer our question and find an answer to our hypothesis, we use graphs to visualize series of numbers and patterns that we wouldn't be able to recognize nor discover just by watching at tabular data. The goal of our graphs is to highlight these differences in a clear way, by using contrasting colors in simple graphs that compare distributions.
To get a more clear and general view, we made use of data scraped not only from the Fandango platform, but from other platforms as well. Comparing Fandango with not only one, but multiple platforms grants us the possibility to have a more objective view. This allows us to confirm whether some reviews of particular movies are particularly low or particularly high only in certain platforms, thus highlighting what people would rate the movies with a smaller chance of being biased.
